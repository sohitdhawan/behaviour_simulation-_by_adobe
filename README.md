# Behaviour-and-Content-Simulation
Behaviour and content simulation challenge was proposed by Adobe where the task was to predict the number of likes on a given twitter post having media files, date of post, company, and content. This is the behaviour simulation task. The Content simulation task is to generate the content of the post using the media files.

The repo as of now consists of a report file which have our entire approach and ideation. Since the company owns our solution, we are trying to modify our solution which will be more improved and may have a slightly different approach. The repo will be updated as soon as possible. The approach to task 2 has been slightly changed and will be commented and modified in the README.md file.
